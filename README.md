# Image Segmentation with SegFormer

SegFormer is a transformer model for semantic segmentation. It uses a hierarchical Transformer encoder to capture lon-range dependencies in the image. The encoder outputs multiple-scale features, which are then fed to a lightweight decoder to produce segmentation mask. SegFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on several segmentation benchmarks
